      <description>Introduction I have been working since more than ten years as Linux System Administrator/DevOps Engineer and I have noticed that the Make tool is not widely used for building a project involving the managing of infrastructure such as Docker, Terraform or miscellaneous automation scripts. In some cases, it may be more efficient to use Makefile instead of Bash script.
What is Make ? Make is a tool that helps to automate some tasks, but what is the benefit of using a Makefile against a shell script ?</description>
